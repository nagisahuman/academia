  <h2>Plans for Reconstruction</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Lincoln
      <ul>
        <li>Appointed military governers.</li>
        <li>Wanted to reconcile with South, not punish.</li>
        <li>Proclamation of Amnesty &amp; Reconstruction said that he would pardon
           those who took an oath of loyalty to the Union.</li>
        <li>New state government could be organized once 10&percent; of state
           voters took oath of loyalty.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Radical Republicans had a very different plan.
      <ul>
        <li>Wanted to completely redo the South.</li>
        <li>Prevent Confederate leaders from returning to power.</li>
        <li>Wanted Republicans to be extremely powerful in the South.</li>
        <li>Political equality for African Americans. This means giving them the
          right to vote.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Wade&dash;Davis bill &lsqb;not passed&rsqb; required white men in
      South to take oath of loyalty to the Union. The states could create new
      state governments. They would have to reject slavery, reject Confederate
       debts, and agree that Confederate officials could no longer be in office
       or vote.</li>
    <li>Freedmen's Bureau was set up to help provide food, clothing, and jobs
       for many in the South, including African Americans.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>More Reconstruction Plans</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Johnson's Plans
      <ul>
        <li>Very similar to Lincoln's plans.</li>
        <li>Believed that the planter elites in South caused the war, and therefore
           would not allow them to take loyalty to the Union.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>South passes black codes. These returned African Americans to slave&dash;like conditions.</li>
    <li>1866 &dash; Civil Rights Act grants citizenship to all born in the United States. This
      excluded Native Americans.</li>
    <li>The 14th amendment is passed, giving all in the U. S. citizenship. This did not include
      Native Americans.</li>
    <li>The Military Reconstruction Act divides the Confederacy into military districts. They soon
      agree to give all males the right to vote.</li>
    <li>Johnson is impeached.
      <ul>
        <li>Republicans do not want him to interfere with plans.</li>
        <li>Tenure of Office Act required president orders to go through the general of the army. The Senate
          must also approve removal of any government official.</li>
        <li>Johnson fires Secretary of War to rebel against this act.</li>
        <li>House of Reps uses this as grounds to impeach Johnson.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>15th amendment is passed, giving all the right to vote.</li>
  </ul>
