  <h2>Conflict</h2>
  <p>As more Americans began moving west and taking control of more land, they began
    to anger the Native Americans. They repeatedly broke promises, and killed a number
    of people. Wounded Knee and Little Bighorn are a few examples of the many conflicts 
    between the Native American people and the United States.</p>
  <h4>Little Bighorn</h4>
    <p>Several settlers were violating a treaty by using the Black Hills in
    the Lakota Sioux reservation. The Lakota opposed this by leaving the reservation.
    In response to this, Colonel George Custer attacked them. However, the Native
    Americans won against this attack.</p>
  <h4>Wounded Knee</h4>
    <p>The Lakota continued to perform the Ghost Dance, which celebrated a hopeful
    day in which the buffalo would return and the settlers would disappear. The
    government agents did not approve of this, and sent police to arrest Sitting Bull,
    the chief, who was killed. Those who partook in the Ghost Dance fled, but many
    of them were killed by U. S. tropps. <br />This event took place at Wounded Knee
    Creek.</p>

  <h2>Government Plans</h2>
  <h4>Indian Peace Commission</h4>
  <p>The Indian Peace Commission was formed in 1867 to create reservations for the
    Native Americans. However, Native Americans were forced into signing these treaties.
    The reservations did not accomplish anything beyond increasing tensions.</p>
  <h4>Assimilation</h4>
  <p>To assimilate the Native Americans would mean to absorb them into the standard
    American culture. They were given small amounts of land which they were allowed
    to use for farming and to live off of. However, the land they were given was
    not profitable, and this idea ultimately failed.</p>
  <p>Indian Boarding schools were also created to &quote;Kill the Indian, Save the Man.&quote;
    These schools forced children to choose new names &dash; names that they could not read
    and did not know the meaning of.  Their hair was cut. They were not allowed to speak
    their native languages. Their clothing changed entirely, and they could not dress
    how they used to. Everything related to their culture was removed from them.</p>
