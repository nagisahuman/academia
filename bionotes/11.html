  <h2>Meiosis</h2>
  <p>Meiosis is a process which creates gametes, AKA sex cells. These cells have
    half the usual number of chromosomes. They will be fertilized with another
    gamete to create a zygote, which will have the full number of chromosomes.</p>
  <h4>Process</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Interphase 1 &dash; chromosomes duplicate</li>
    <li>Prophase 1 &dash; chromosomes cross over with corresponding chromosomes. This
    causes them to exchange some of the alleles, producing a new combination of
    alleles.</li>
    <li>Metaphase 1 &dash; chromosomes attach to spindle</li>
    <li>Anaphase 1 &dash; chromosomes move to cell poles</li>
    <li>Telophase 1 and Cytokinesis &dash; cell divides into two cells. Each of these
    cells will undergo the rest of meiosis.</li>
    <li>Prophase 2 through end of Meiosis 2 &dash; normal mitosis happens. Overall,
    four genetically different daughter cells are formed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Mendel</h2>
  <p>Gregor Mendel was a monk who was essentially the founding father of genetics,
    which is known as the scientific study of how characteristics are passed down
    between organisms.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>trait</dt><dd> a specific characteristic</dd>
    <dt>gene</dt><dd> a chemical factor that determines a trait</dd>
    <dt>alleles</dt><dd> the different forms of a gene</dd>
    <dt>segregation</dt><dd> the separation of alleles</dd>
  </dl>
  <h4>Law of Segregation</h4>
  <p>Alleles separate during gamete formation so that gametes will only carry one
    copy of a gene.</p>
  <h4>Law of Independent Assortment</h4>
  <p>Genes segregate independently of each other.</p>

  <h2>Punnet Squares</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Dominant trait</dt><dd> will always be represented. Symbolized by a capital letter.</dd>
    <dt>Recessive trait</dt><dd> will only be represented if both copies of an allele are present. Symbolized by a lowercase letter.</dd>
    <dt>Homozygous</dt><dd> if an organism has two of the same allele. Both letters are capital, or both letters are lowercase.</dd>
    <dt>Heterozygous</dt><dd> if an organism has two different alleles. One letter is capital, while the other is lowercase.</dd>
    <dt>Phenotype</dt><dd> the physical characteristic.</dd>
    <dt>Genotype</dt><dd> the genetic makeup.</dd>
  </dl>
  <h4>Example</h4>
  <p>This shows two organisms that are heterozygous for trait E being crossed with
    each other. Their offspring will be one of the given genotypes.</p>

  <h2>More Genetics</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>incomplete dominance</dt><dd> when neither allele is completely dominant. This creates a phenotype between the two alleles.</dd>
    <dt>codominance</dt><dd> when both alleles contribute to the phenotype. This means that both alleles can be seen clearly.</dd>
    <dt>multiple alleles</dt><dd> if a gene has more than two alleles in the population.</dd>
    <dt>polygenic traits</dt><dd> traits that are controlled by more than one gene.</dd>
