  <h2>Ideas Supporting Darwin</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Hutton &dash; noticed that geological forces operate over time. Therefore,
      the Earth has to be more than a few thousand years old.</li>
    <li>Lyell &dash; noticed that geological feautures would be built up or
      destroyed over long periods of time.</li>
    <li>Lamarck &dash; recognized that living things change over time and adapt to
      their environments. However, he was wrong, for he thought that organs would
      change depending on use. He also thought that already born descendents would
      change if the parent changed.</li>
    <li>Malthus &dash; noticed that disease, famine, and war were the only things
      preventing exponential population growth.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Theory of Evolution</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Natural selection &dash; the idea that only the organisms that are best
      suited to their environments will survive.</li>
    <li>Variation &dash; how offspring will vary in small ways. This can increase
      or decrease the chance of an organism surviving.</li>
    <li>Struggle for existence &dash; how individuals compete for limited resources.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Evidence of Evolution</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fossils</li>
    <li>Homologous structures &dash; structures in organisms that are similar but serve different purposes.</li>
    <li>Vestigial organs &dash; organs present in an organism that are no longer used.</li>
