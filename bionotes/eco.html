  <h2>Ecology</h2>
  <p>Ecology is the study of interactions amongst organisms, and interactions between
    organisms and their environment. <br />
    The biosphere is where all life exists, including in water, in air, or on land. <br />
  A species is a group of organisms which can interbreed to create fertile offspring.</p>
  <p>The levels of organization are as follows&colon;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>individuals</li>
    <li>population &dash; all members of the same species in a defined area.</li>
    <li>community &dash; all populations in a defined area</li>
    <li>ecosystem &dash; all communities &amp; abiotic factors</li>
    <li>biome &dash; ecosystems with similar climate and similar dominant communities</li>
    <li>biosphere</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Energy Flow</h2>
  <h4>Producers</h4>
  <p>Producers are organisms which can make their own food. Photoautotrophs, which rely on
    the sun for energy, and chemoautotrophs, which rely on inorganic compounds for energy,
    are examples of producers.</p>
  <h4>Consumers</h4>
  <p>Consumers are organisms which rely on other organisms for food. The most commonly known
    consumers are herbivores, which eat plants, carnivores, which eat meat, and omnivores, which
    eat both plants and meat. Detritivores eat the remains of other consumers, aka dead stuff.
    Decomposers are a special type of consumer who break down organic matter. Decomposers are
    primarily bacteria and fungi.</p>
  <h4>Diagrams</h4>
  <p>Food chains show how a single organism gets passed in a linear chain. Food webs, on the other hand,
    show all of the food chains in an ecosystem.</p>
  <h4>Ecological Pyramids</h4>
  <p>These show energy on each step of a food web. There are three main types&colon;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Energy &dash; these show the amount of energy in each trophic level. They follow the ten percent rule,
      which means that only ten percent of the energy gets passed to the next level.</li>
    <li>Biomass &dash; these show the amount of living tissue in an area. This then shows the amount
      of potential food available.</li>
    <li>Numbers &dash; these show the number of organisms on each trophic level.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Biogeochemical Cycles</h2>
  <h4>Nitrogen Cycle</h4>
  <p>Animal waste & plant matter is affected by decomposers. The decomposers break
    down the waste & matter to create ammonia and ammonium, which will become nitrites
    and nitrates. Denitrifying bacteria will lead to an increase in the nitrogen in the
    atmosphere. The nitrogen in the atmosphere will either become ammonia/ammonium when being
    fixated by nitrogen-fixing bacteria, or will become nitrates due to fertilizers
     or atmospheric fixation.</p>

  <h4>Carbon Cycle</h4>
  <p>The burning of wood & fossil fuels causes an increase of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere.
    This will be used in photosynthesis, and may become detritus due to being consumed
    by different living things. Detritivores will then take this detritus and use it.
    Eventually, through cellular respiration by living things that undergo cellular respiration,
    the CO<sub>2</sub> will be back in the atmosphere, and the cycle will happen again.</p>

  <h4>Phosphorous Cycle</h4>
  <p>Phosphates in organic compounds may be eaten by consumers, and will eventually
    become detritus. Detritivores will cause them to decompose further, which will contribute
    to the nonorganic phosphates in the soil. These phosphates may end up in organic compounds
    again, and the cycle will begin again. However, the phosphates may also end
    up in water, and will eventually make their way into rock. After a long period
    of time, this rock may find itself on land, and the phosphates may eventually make
    their way back into the phosphorous cycle.</p>

  <h2>Weather &amp; Climate</h2>
  <p>Weather is the day to day conditions of an area, while climate is the average
    temperature and precipitation in a region.<br />
    The greenhouse effect is how gases in the atmosphere trap heat energy and
    impact the temperature of the Earth.</p>

  <h2>Ecosystems</h2>
  <dl>
  <dt>biotic factors</dt><dd> biological factors</dd>
  <dt>abiotic factors</dt><dd> factors that are not alive. include temperature, weather, geographic factors, and other things.</dd>
  <dt>competitive exclusion principle</dt><dd> the fact that no two species can inhabit the same niche in the same location at the same time.</dd>
  <dt>symbiosis</dt><dd> a relationship in which two organisms live closely together. includes mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism.</dd>
  <dt>mutualism</dt><dd> a relationship in which both organisms benefit.</dd>
  <dt>commensalism</dt><dd> a relationship in which one organism benefits, while the other is not harmed or benefited in any way.</dd>
  <dt>parasitism</dt><dd> a relationship in which one organism benefits, while the other is harmed and may die.</dd>
  <dt>ecological succession</dt><dd> the predictable changes in a community over time.</dd>
  <dt>primary succession</dt><dd> succession when no soil exists.</dd>
  <dt>pioneer species</dt><dd> the first species in an area. often lichen or moss.</dd>
  <dt>secondary succession</dt><dd> succession that happens after a major disturbance.</dd>
