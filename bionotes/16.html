  <h2>Phenotype Distribution</h2>
  <p>The phenotypes in a population are impacted by natural selection. This can happene
    in three ways.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Directional selection causes the phenotype distribution to shift in a particular direction
      on a bell curve.</li>
    <li>Stabilizing selection causes one phenotype in the middle of a bell curve to increase.</li>
    <li>Disruptive selection causes to unique phenotypes in a population.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Genetic Equilibrium</h2>
  <p>The Hardy&dash;Weinberg principle states that allele frequencies are consistent
    in a population unless one particular factor changes. Genetic equilibrium is
    when allele frequencies remain constant. These factors impacting genetic equilibrium are&colon;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Random mating</li>
    <li>No movement into or out of a population</li>
    <li>Large population</li>
    <li>No mutations</li>
    <li>No natural selection</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Speciation</h2>
  <p>Speciation is the creation of a new species. This begins with a portion of
    a population becoming isolated. This isolation can be behavioral, geographic,
    or temporal.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Behavioral isolation occurs when mating behaviors change.</li>
      <li>Geographic isolation occurs when part of the population is physically
        separated from the rest of the population.</li>
      <li>Temporal isolation occurs when parts of a population mate at different times.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Once a species is separated by one of these factors, the gene pool will change.
    The changes in a gene pool eventually lead to the members of the original population
    not being able to breed with each other. A species is only made up of members
    that can interbreed. As these two populations cannot breed with each other, a
    new species has been created.</p>
